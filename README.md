*Version 1.0b (pre-final)*

## Known Issues

* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] The wishlist is missing, despite the "add to wishlist" heart-shaped buttons available throughout.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] Search bar in the top navigation does not work.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] HTML validator shows some errors. (CSS is ok. the errors CSS validator gives show that it's just a bit behind the newer CSS features).
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*products.htm*]: Sidebar controls do not work. Particularly, the "Colors", "Brand" and "Discount" filters are not implemented. (The intended behavior is to have checkboxes there. Also, to have nice corresponding icons throughout for different colors, size. Also, rating stars are missing in product cards and descriptions).
