*Version 1.0b (pre-final)*

## Known Issues

* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] The wishlist is missing, despite the "add to wishlist" heart-shaped buttons available throughout.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] Search bar in the top navigation does not work.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*All pages*] HTML validator shows some errors. (CSS is ok. the errors CSS validator gives show that it's just a bit behind the newer CSS features).
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*products.htm*]: Sidebar controls do not work. Particularly, the "Colors", "Brand" and "Discount" filters are not implemented. (The intended behavior is to have checkboxes there. Also, to have nice corresponding icons throughout for different colors, size. Also, rating stars are missing in product cards and descriptions).
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*product_details.htm/product_details_X.htm*] "Add to Cart" button does nothing. It is supposed to fill the Shopping Cart.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*about_us.htm*] There is still some Lorem Ipsum left, as well as buttons that do nothing.
* **Desktop** and **Mobile**: [*shopping_cart.htm*] Underdeveloped page. Products are not linked with their detail pages yet, the "delete" button does not work, and the "Checkout" panel is unfinished. The purchase completion step is missing altogether.
* **Mobile**: [*Landing Page (index.htm)*] Extraneous padding in the hero yellow header. Also, video sequences get improperly cropped at this width and some are not recognizable anymore.
* **Mobile**: [*products.htm*]: The sidebar is too wide, squishing away the product cards. The better solution for mobile widths would be to turn the sidebar into a top bar, similar to what's been done in Help page, and making it sticky, so it stays when scrolling through the products.
* **Mobile**: [*product_details.htm/product_details_X.htm*]: Extraneous padding and broken alignment all along.
* **Mobile**: [*about_us.htm*] The header gets resized wrongly, leading to the loss of most of the content. The association between squares of a same row gets lost as well - the blocks of text and images do not look connected anymore.
* **Mobile**: [*citations.htm*] The header image gets resized wrongly (it's supposed to be taller), and the title is too big. Also, not enough left-right padding throughout, and it is hard to tell one citation from another.
* **Mobile**: [*under_construction.htm*] This page is not responsive at all, unfortunately.
* **Mobile**: [*shopping_cart.htm*] Lacks responsiveness as well. The user arguably can still complete the task, but all alignments are broken and the resulting UX is frankly poor.
